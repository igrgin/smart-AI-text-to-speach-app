# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This repo uses a **single-context** domain documentation layout.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** for ADRs that touch the area about to be worked in.

If any of these files do not exist, **proceed silently**. Do not flag their absence; do not suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill, reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`, creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
|-- CONTEXT.md
|-- docs/adr/
|   |-- 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
|   `-- 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
`-- src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, or a test name, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need is not in the glossary yet, that is a signal: either you are inventing language the project does not use, or there is a real gap to note for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because...
